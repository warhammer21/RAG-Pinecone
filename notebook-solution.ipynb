We will be using LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone vector DB, to build a chatbot capable of learning from the external world using **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG).\n\nWe will be using a dataset sourced from the Llama 2 ArXiv paper and other related papers to help our chatbot answer questions about the latest and greatest in the world of GenAI.\n\nThis project is designed for learners who have a basic understanding of the OpenAI API and Pinecone, as covered in our previous projects. It's a great opportunity for those interested in AI, machine learning, and NLP to get hands-on experience with building a chatbot with RAG.\n\n![rag](rag.png)\n\nBy the end of this project, you will have a functioning chatbot and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on a knowledge base. This project is a stepping stone towards understanding and building more complex AI systems in the future.","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Maintenance note, May 2024\n\nSince this code-along was released, the Python packages for working with the Pinecone and OpenAI APIs have changed their syntax. The instructions, hints, and code have been updated to use the latest syntax, but the video has not been updated. Consequently, it is now slightly out of sync.

Here's a brief overview of what each library does:\n\n- **openai**: This is the official OpenAI Python client. We'll use it to interact with the GPT large language model.\n- **pinecone-client**: This is the official Pinecone Python client. We'll use it to interact with the Pinecone vector DB where we will store our chatbot's knowledge base.\n- **langchain**, **langchain-openai**, **langchain-pinecone**: This is a library for GenAI. We'll use it to chain together different language models and components for our chatbot.\n- **tiktoken**: This is a library from OpenAI that allows you to count the number of tokens in a text string without making an API call.\n- **datasets**: This library provides a vast array of datasets for machine learning. We'll use it to load our knowledge base for the chatbot.\n\nYou can install these libraries using pip like

These two theories are highly successful in their respective domains but are incompatible when applied together in certain extreme situations, such as at the center of a black hole or during the Big Bang.\n\nString theory offers a framework that can consistently describe both gravity and the other fundamental forces within a single theoretical framework. By treating particles as tiny, vibrating strings instead of point-like particles, string theory can potentially provide a more fundamental and unified description of the forces and particles in the universe.\n\nAdditionally, string theory naturally incorporates the idea of supersymmetry, which is a proposed symmetry between particles with different spin quantum numbers. Supersymmetry could help address some of the outstanding issues in particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter.\n\nWhile string theory has not yet been experimentally confirmed, its mathematical elegance and potential to unify fundamental forces make it an attractive candidate for a unified theory of physics.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also: (1) Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data, (2) Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment. As such, the LangChain framework is designed with the objective in mind to enable those types of applications.\n\nQuery: Can you tell me about the LLMChain in LangChain?\n"}]},{"source":"Now we feed this into our chatbot as we did before.\n\nDon't append the previous AI message, since it wasn't a good answer.","metadata":{},"id":"686b36f9-9107-4099-b0da-22e60e4b17e6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions\n\nInclude the augmented prompt in the conversation.\n\n- Print the last message in the list.\n- Replace the last message with a human message containing the augmented prompt.","metadata":{},"id":"aa19e06d-a9c0-4b25-bf3b-072b2f163852","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"<details>\n<summary>Code hints</summary>\n<p>\n    \nThe last element of a list can be accessed with the position `-1`.\n    \n```py\n# Get the last element of a list\nlst[-1]\n\n# Replace the last element of a list\nlst[-1] = new_value\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>","metadata":{},"id":"55e6f4b0-3d2a-445d-82d6-9dfc8635db50","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Print the last message in the conversation\nprint(messages[-1])","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":50,"lastExecutedAt":1716001880254,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Print the last message in the conversation\nprint(messages[-1])","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":38,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"9e75850b-3e18-4e02-a641-a37c02b4177f"},"id":"a7e0ee47-69f2-4f21-b48d-279e9ae5df3e","cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"content='Can you tell me about the LLMChain in LangChain?'\n"}]},{"source":"# Replace the last message with a human message containing the augmented prompt\nmessages[-1] = HumanMessage(content=augmented_prompt)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":50,"lastExecutedAt":1716001880304,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Replace the last message with a human message containing the augmented prompt\nmessages[-1] = HumanMessage(content=augmented_prompt)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":368,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"9e75850b-3e18-4e02-a641-a37c02b4177f"},"id":"901893e6-726d-4a42-805f-ee2d24b3b8a2","cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### Instructions\n\nAsk GPT about LangChain again, this time providing source knowledge.\n\n- Send the messages to GPT.
